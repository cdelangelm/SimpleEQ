# SimpleEQ
C++ Audio Plugin with Juce Framework.

This is a project from the 5 hour coding course given by Charles Schiermeyer otherwise known as Matkat Music, at https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-modern-cpp-by-building-an-audio-plugin/.

---------------------------------------------------------------------COURSE DESCRIPTION----------------------------------------------------------------

This course was developed by Charles Schiermeyer, known as Matkat Music. Not only is Charles an experienced programmer, he is an excellent musician and has been nominated 3 times
for a Grammy.

In this course, you will learn how to create an audio plugin that has a 3 band equalizer with a spectrum analyzer at the top. It has a low cut band, high cut band, and parametric
band. Don't know what those things are? No problem. You will not only learn about programming, but you will learn a little about music as well.

You will learn how to use the JUCE framework to create the plugin. This is a cross-platform C++ application framework, used for the development of desktop and mobile applications.

Here are the sections covered in this course:

-Setting up the Project

-Creating Audio Parameters

-Setting up the DSP

-Setting up Audio Plugin Host

-Connecting the Peak Params

-Connecting the LowCut Params

-Refactoring the DSP

-Adding Sliders to GUI

-Draw the Response Curve

-Build the Response Curve Component

-Customize Slider Visuals

-Response Curve Grid

-Spectrum Analyzer

-Bypass Buttons
